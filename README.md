                <h2>Understanding the Challenge</h2>
                <p>Delhi faces significant challenges with both air quality and waste management. These issues are not isolated; they are deeply interconnected, creating a complex problem that affects the health and well-being of its residents and the overall sustainability of the city.</p>

                <h3>Air Pollution in Delhi (Related to SDG 3 & 11)</h3>
                <p>Delhi's air pollution levels often reach hazardous levels, contributing to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular problems, and other health issues (SDG 3). Key contributors include vehicular emissions, industrial activities, construction dust, and, significantly, the open burning of waste. This poor air quality also undermines the goal of creating sustainable and healthy cities (SDG 11).</p>

                <h3>Waste Management Crisis in Delhi (SDG 12)</h3>
                <p>The city generates vast amounts of waste daily, and the current infrastructure for collection, segregation, and processing is often overwhelmed. This leads to overflowing landfills, uncollected waste in public spaces, and the harmful practice of open burning, which directly exacerbates air pollution (impacting SDG 3 and 11). Inefficient waste management hinders progress towards responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).</p>

                <h3>The Direct Link: Waste Burning and Air Quality</h3>
                <p>A major point of intersection is the widespread practice of burning solid waste. This releases harmful pollutants directly into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to Delhi's poor air quality. Addressing waste management effectively is crucial for tackling air pollution.</p>
